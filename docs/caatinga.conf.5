.SH NAME
caatinga.conf \- configuration file for the
.B caat
and
.B lscaat
backup and restore programs.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B caatinga.conf


.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.B caatinga.conf
contains configuration options for the
.B caat
and
.B lscaat
backup and restore programs.  These options control where the backups are to be
stored, as well as provide a degree of control over what files get backed up.

.B root
.RS
The root directory of the system that is going to be backed up.
.RE

.B max_file_size
.RS
Do not backup files larger than this value.  Size is in MB.
.RE

.B drive_percentage
.RS
How full must the backup drive get before old backups start to be deleted.
.RE

.B backup_location
.RS
The mount point of the backup device where the backups will be written to.
.RE

.B backup_group
.RS
Group name that backups are owned by.  Be sure to add users to this group
that you want to grant access to the backup drive.  This option should also
be set prior to registering a backup device to insure proper ownership is set.
.RE

.B reduce_backups
.RS
Value can be yes or no.  If set to yes the backups will automatically be
reduced to a daily frequency for 31 days, then reduced to weekly.
.RE

.B ignore
.RS
Do not backup these files or directories.  This entry can appear more than once
in the file and may also contain glob expressions.
.RE

.B pre_hooks
.RS
Defines a directory that contains scrips to be executed prior to a backup.
Each executable script in this directory will be ran in alphabetical order.
In the event a script exits with a non zero exit status, any remaining scripts
will not execute and the backup will terminate.
.RE

.B post_hooks
.RS
Defines a directory that contains scrips to be executed after a backup
completes.  Each executable script in this directory will be ran in alphabetical
order.  In the event a script exits with a non zero exit status, any remaining
scripts will not execute and the backup will terminate.
.RE

Note:  The pre_hooks and post_hooks options are available in case some setup and
tear down requrements need to be met when performing a backup.  For example, an
lvm snapshot needs to be made and destroyed, an SQL dump needs to run, the
backup destination needs to be mounted and unmounted.
