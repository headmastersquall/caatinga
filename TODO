- Update CommandArgs to use argparse.

- Update setup.py to use setuptools/distribute instead of distutils.

- Create an AUR PKGBUILD

- Add locking support to prevent more than one backup to run at the same time.

- Add hooks support to allow scripts to run pre and post backup.  This would be
  useful for creating sql dumps.

- Store the permissions, and ownership in a database instead of preserving them
  on the backed up file.  This would allow backups to be ran on mounted nfs
  shares.  Create a file in each directory containing the permissions of the
  containing files.  This needs some thought to make sure it is a feature that
  follows the goal of this application.

- Add an option in caatinga.conf to allow the user to define their own diff
  program

- Add ucaat and ulscaat commands for running backups for just the users home
  directory.  Note: The user module can be used here to get the users home
  directory.

- Create a new command called caatspace that would allow a loopback or qcow
  type file to be created and used as a local backup device.

  Command options:

    create - Create a new file to use as a backup drive.  This will
             create a loopback device with a compatible file system, then
             register it as a backup device.  Optional arguments available
             to create alternative filesystems.  The default filesystem will be
             ext4, but an option should be available for the user to choose.

    mount - Mounts the drive that was created.

    umount - Unmounts the drive.
